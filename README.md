### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Free software developer and loves Debian (newbie Debian Developer).

I'm working as a software engineer at [ClearCode Inc](https://www.clear-code.com).
We drive forward free softwares and make the business.

For example, especially developing [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) as a community member and support it for [enterprise use case](https://www.fluentd.org/enterprise_services) and so on.
